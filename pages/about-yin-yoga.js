        <h1><b>About Meridian Yoga Therapy<b></h1>

        <p><i>Meridian Yoga Therapy combines ancient Chinese and Yogic principles to remove blockages + stagnation that may manifest as symptoms or dis-ease.

        </p>
      
      <p>Modern lifestyle poses its challenges resulting in emotional and physical patterns that can get us uncomfortable, stuck or hinder us in daily or recreational activities. 
      Meridian Yoga Therapy combines ancient Chinese and Yogic principles to remove energetic blockages and qi stagnation that manifest as symptoms or dis-ease. 
      A regular routine focusing on these pathways and points will aid our body to return to a state of balance and health. The practice will take you on a journey to dive deep 
      into yourself and explore the wonders of your body and the points and pathways running through it, fostering healing, body awareness and energetic balancing. 
      We will use asana, breathing techniques and acupressure points to ease the flow of energy through these channels and relieve stress, muscle aches, pain, tension, headaches, 
      digestive issues, anxiety, depression and postural issues.</p>
      
      <h2><b>About the meridians<b></h2>
      
      <p>Our vital energy (also called Qi or Prana) flows through a network of energetic pathways in our body. Chinese Medicine calls them meridians, the Yogis call them nadis. 
    Along these pathways lie acupressure points. These pathways and points connect our organs and their functions. Imagine the underground train map of a larger city. 
    Each train line is a meridian and the stops are acupressure points. If there is an issue at one of the stops, it interferes with the whole line. 
    The location where two or more lines cross at an intersection forms points of importance. For energy and blood to be evenly distributed within our body, the pathways 
    need to be unobstructed. By holding certain asana and pressing acupressure points, we can unblock and activate the points and pathways that run through our body, 
      restoring the natural functions of our tissue and organs. We can clear excess energy or infuse deficient energy.</p>
