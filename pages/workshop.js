          <p>Come and join us weekly for a restoring Yin Yoga and Reiki session. In each session, we will focus on one of the 5 elements of Traditional Chinese Medicine. 
          The first sessions on November 16th and November 19th we will work with the metal element. The metal element relates to late autumn. Our practice focusing on the 
          large intestine and lung pathways will strengthen our immune system, respiratory tract, build our self-esteem, helps us form boundaries and connect us to the 
          present moment. We will start with a guided meditation led by Judith, followed by a yoga practice with Kat and end with an extended final relaxation where Judith 
          will be sending Kundalini Reiki to everyone.
